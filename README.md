# JS-Projects
Build core JS skills

04/22 I am putting a pause on advancing with React to go back to vanilla javascript. I want to make sure I have a strong understanding and can build simple projects on my own before advancing. Today was rough. I realized I am not at the proficiency I want to be at.

04/26 Completed EVENT LISTENERS > Colour On Click. 
      To-do: Add windows background + start up sound if all 4 colours are active.
             Re-write code using conditions or cases (?) so each square does not require its own function.
