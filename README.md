# JS-Projects
Build core JS skills

04/22 I am putting a pause on advancing with React to go back to vanilla javascript. I want to make sure I have a strong understanding and can build simple projects on my own before advancing. Today was rough. I realized I am not at the proficiency I want to be at.

04/26 Completed EVENT LISTENERS > Colour On Click. 
      To-do: Add windows background + start up sound if all 4 colours are active.
             Re-write code using conditions or cases (?) so each square does not require its own function.
             
04/29 Completed APIs > Tarot Reading.
      Used API https://github.com/ekelen/tarot-api
      Utilized for loops to condense code from 200+ lines to 57 lines of JavaScript.
      
05/01 Welcome to May! I am choosing to begin a new vanilla js project using a new API to continue my practice with fetch and async..await.

05/04 Completed API > Uni Search.
      Used API https://github.com/Hipo/university-domains-list-api
      Project is running locally, however, failing when served on Github with the following error "Failed to load resource: net::ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED".
      To-do: fix error with fetch API, add pagination.
      
05/05 Working through some tutorials today, adapting functions to arrow format to get comfortable with the syntax.

05/08 Complete v1 of LISTS > Shop List 2.0.
      I'm not a fan of the code structure, I relied heavily on CSS and event targets. Although I did learn a lot of cool new tricks and have a better understanding of e.target.
      To-do: Re-write code using arrays and objects.
             Add counter.
